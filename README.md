<b>Web Chat Application<b>
This project involves the creation of a web chat application. The choice of technologies for building the application is flexible; what matters is that the chosen technologies can meet all the requirements of the functional specification. The application's code should be hosted on GitHub.

The provided chat application should exhibit the following functionalities (refer to Figure 1 and Figure 2 on the next page):

Ability to create new text messages.
Sending a message upon pressing "Enter" or clicking the "Send" button (displaying the message on the screen along with the author's name).
Assigning a random color and/or name to each participant in the chat, enabling their identification.
Connecting to the Scaledrone service (further instructions about the service provided in the attachment) and successfully simulating conversations among all active users.
Availability via a public GitHub repository.
